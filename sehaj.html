<p>Stress makes us uncomfortable and uneasy. Stress may be caused by many reasons like 
exams, relationships and money
Scholars who appear for various exams fail to manage their social lives which causes 
terrible fell & stress in their minds.
Money plays an important role in our lives. All our needs and desires can be fulfilled by 
money. In the absence of money we have to borrow money from others in order to get our 
needs fulfilled. Our failure to replay the borrowings causes a lot of stress in our minds.
Many a time’s failures while dealing with the relationships lead to stress. Needless to say 
that happy relationship benefits people in a number of ways. But when these relationships become unsuccessful it causes a lot of stress.</p>
